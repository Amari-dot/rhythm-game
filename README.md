# rhythm-game
Hi thanks for visiting me. 
This is the first time I made a huge game and posted it on gitHub. 
I am very proud of it.
This is a two player racing game. The goal is to get to the blinking square. When you see the color white move. There is music. 
I appreciate all feedback and comments thank you.
